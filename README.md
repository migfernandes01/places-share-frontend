## Share the best places!


### Description:
Fully responsive full-stack web app where users can share places, using a photo, description and address.

### Used Technologies:
- **React:** As a frontend framework
- **Node.js:** As a backend javascript environment
- **Express:** As a backend framework to build the REST API
- **MongoDB:** As a database
- **bcrypt:** To encrypt passwords
- **JWT:** To create the authorization token
- **AWS S3:** To store images
- **Google Maps:** To show and interactive map

### Goals of this project:
This was the first project I created using the MERN stack. Before this, I already knew all the technologies of the stack,
but this is the first time I use them all together. My biggest goal with this app was to learn the proper way of connecting
the backend and frontend. I can say I learned a lot, especially about designing and structuring the code both on the backend(using different files for routes, controllers, middlewares and models) and the frontend(creating flexible components).
